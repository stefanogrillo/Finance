# Finance
This is a webpage made for Finance: you can search, buy, and sell any shares available in the market.

This is a guided project from CS50 course. The main script is available [here](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset9/finance). 

This <i>online application</i> is developed using <i>Flask</i>. It has a database, and uses an API to retrieve information about the shares.<br>
Overall, the application starts asking to the user either to register or to enter his/her own account.
