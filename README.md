# Finance
This is a webpage made for Finance: you can search, buy, and sell any shares available in the market.

This is a guided project from CS50 course. The main script is available [here](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset9/finance). 

This <i>Web Application</i> is developed using <i>Flask</i> for the server side, and using <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i> and <i>Bootstrap</i> for the webpage. It has a database, and also uses an API to retrieve information about the shares from <i>IEX</i>.<br>
Overall, the application starts asking to the user either to <i>Register</i> or to <i>Log In</i> into his/her own account. The <i>Registering</i> process requires ... and it allows the user inside the application, once completed.

The <i>Log In</i> process is easier: it only requires the username and the password.

After these steps, the user is welcomed into an <i>Index</i>.
