# Finance
This is a Financial Web App: you can search, buy, and sell any share available in the market.

This is a [guided project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/9/finance/) from CS50 course. My script is available [here](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset9/finance). My core objectives were: create a Register Page for new users, a Log In, an Index, a page to see current Quotations, a Buy page, a Sell page, an History of transactions, an Add/Withdraw Cash, and the possibility to Change the Password for the user. 

This <i>Web Application</i> is developed using Python's <i>Flask</i> for the backend, and using <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, <i>JavaScript</i> and <i>Bootstrap</i> for the webpage. The webapp has a database in <i>SQLite</i>, and uses an <i>API</i> to retrieve information about the shares' quotations from <i>IEX</i>.<br>
The application starts asking to the user to <i>Register</i> his/her own account. The <i>Registering</i> process requires ... and it allows the user inside the application, once completed.

![]()

The <i>Log In</i> process is easier: it only requires the username and the password.

After these steps, the user is welcomed into an <i>Index</i>.
